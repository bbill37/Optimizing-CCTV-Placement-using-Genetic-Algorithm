 CCTV Placement Optimization
The use of closed-circuit television, for short CCTV, cameras has become increasingly common in building security systems, as it provides real-time monitoring and recording of activities.
However, the placement of CCTV cameras can be a challenging task, as it requires a balance between minimizing the number of cameras used and maximizing the field of view. 
In this project, we aim to optimize the placement of CCTV cameras in indoor buildings using genetic algorithm
